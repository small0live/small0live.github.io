I'm a member of the faculty at the University of Montana (UM). Broadly, my interests span the study of cognition, behavior, and technology in groups. I integrate approaches from the social and computational sciences to enhance teamwork. Currently, I serve as PI for a U.S. DOE sponsored research project on collaboration and software in scientific computing. My other research projects examine topics in training and expertise in human-machine systems. I also [teach in UM's Master of Science in Business Analytics program](/teaching/). 

Some of my recent accomplishments are highlighted below.

- Co-organized the Toward Next-Generation Ecosystems for Scientific Computing Workshop hosted at Argonne National Laboratory (April-May 2025).
