I'm a member of the faculty at the University of Montana (UM). Broadly, my interests span the study of cognition, behavior, and technology in groups. I integrate approaches from the social and computational sciences to enhance teamwork. My current research examines collaboration and software in scientific computing. I also teach in UM's Master of Science in Business Analytics program. 

Some of my recent accomplishments are highlighted below.
