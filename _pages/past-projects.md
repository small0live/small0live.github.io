### As Principal Investigator

#### Team Learning for Better Scientific Software

This project advances the study of team learning in scientific software via development of a framework for future research and creation of resources for teams. The associated work was funded by a 1-year award to Olivia B. Newton via the <a href="https://bssw.io/blog_posts/introducing-the-2024-bssw-fellows">2024 Better Scientific Software Fellowship</a>.

* Sponsors: U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Science Foundation ($25,000)
