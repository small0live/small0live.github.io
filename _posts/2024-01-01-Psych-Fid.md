#### My Role

I'm co-leading this project with my undergraduate mentee, Andy Silva, at the University of Central Florida.

#### Motivation 

* Psychological fidelity is the degree that a simulation produces affective and cognitive processes that correspond to the real-world environment. The concept
* It has been identified as an essential aspect of training efficacy and may be uniquely important for team training. 
* Notably, psychological fidelity has been associated with credibility, suspension of disbelief, and engagement in simulation-based training (SBT).
* The concept of psychological fidelity in SBT was first introduced at least three decades ago but remains underutilized in the development and evaluation of simulation.

#### Approach

* Systematic literature review

#### Preliminary Findings
