Psychological fidelity, or the degree that a simulation produces affective and cognitive processes that correspond to the real-world environment, has been identified as an essential aspect of training efficacy and in particular for team training. Notably, psychological fidelity "*correlates strongly to credibility, suspension of disbelief, and engagement*" (Kuipers et al., 2019).

Although the notion of psychological fidelity in simulation-based training was introduced in the literature as early three decades ago (e.g., Patrick et al., 1996), the concept remains understudied and underutilized in the development and evaluation of simulation. As such, there is a need to grow research on psychological fidelity in simulation.
